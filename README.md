# Personal-Portfolio
As part of a [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) frontend assignment a personal portfolio website was required. Link to the official website can be found [here] (http://salvatoresaia.com/Personal-Portfolio/)

## Approach

In order to achieve the required layout CSS3 feature Flexbox was used. In order to give semantic meaning to the page divs were eliminated as much as possible and was replaced with HTML5 tags such as **header, section and footer**.

The hamburger menu was compulsary which was a means for freecodecamp to control that all students achieved everything within their criteria in order for me to pass the assignment and move onto the next phase. Within the footer the icons used was extracted from the Fontawesome CDN.
